I am a Research Associate in [Brent Richards](https://www.mcgill.ca/genepi/)' Lab at the Lady Davis Instute & McGill University. Prior to joining the lab, I completed my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics under the supervision of [Guillaume Lettre](http://www.mhi-humangenetics.org/fr/membres/). 

As a computational biologist, my research focuses on analyses to identify the genetic determinants of common, aging-related endocrine diseases. In my thesis project, I integrated multiple omics datasets to uncover severity modifiers of sickle cell disease. 

My curriculum vitae can be found [here](assets/pdf/example_pdf.pdf).

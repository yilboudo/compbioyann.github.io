I am a Posdoctoral Research Fellow in [Tinashe Chicokowore's Lab](https://www.tinashechikowore.com/), in the Channing Division of Network Medicine & Brigham and Women’s Hospital & Harvard Medical School.

Previously, I worked as a research associate in [Brent Richards](https://www.mcgill.ca/genepi/)' Lab at the Lady Davis Institute & McGill University. Prior to joining the lab, I completed my Ph.D. in bioinformatics under the supervision of [Guillaume Lettre](http://www.mhi-humangenetics.org/fr/membres/). 

As a computational biologist, my research focuses on performing sophisticated computational analyses of biological data. In my thesis project, I integrated multiple omics datasets to uncover the severity modifiers of sickle cell disease.

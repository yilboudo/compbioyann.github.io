  abstract={Background: Observational studies have found that vitamin D supplementation is associated with improved cognition. Further, recent Mendelian randomization (MR) studies have shown that higher vitamin D levels, 25(OH)D, may protect against Alzheimer's disease. Thus, it is possible that 25(OH)D may protect against Alzheimer's disease by improving cognition.
Objective: We assessed this hypothesis, by examining the relationship between 25(OH)D levels and seven cognitive measurements.

Methods: To mitigate bias from confounding, we performed two-sample MR analyses. We used instruments from three publications: Manousaki et al. (2020), Sutherland et al. (2022), and the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration/EPIC-CVD/Vitamin D Studies Collaboration (2021).

Results: Our observational studies suggested a protective association between 25(OH)D levels and cognitive measures. An increase in the natural log of 25(OH)D by 1 SD was associated with a higher PACC score (BetaPACC score = 0.06, 95% CI = (0.04-0.08); p = 1.8Ã—10-10). However, in the MR analyses, the estimated effect of 25(OH)D on cognitive measures was null. Specifically, per 1 SD increase in genetically estimated natural log of 25(OH)D, the PACC scores remained unchanged in the overall population, (BetaPACC score = -0.01, 95% CI (-0.06 to 0.03); p = 0.53), and amongst individuals aged over 60 (BetaPACC score = 0.03, 95% CI (-0.028 to 0.08); p = 0.35).

Conclusions: In conclusion, our MR study found no clear evidence to support a protective role of increased 25(OH)D concentrations on cognitive performance in European ancestry individuals. However, our study cannot entirely dismiss the potential beneficial effect on PACC for individuals over the age of 60.},

  title={The influence of trinucleotide repeats in the androgen receptor gene on
androgen-related traits and diseases},
  author={T Sasako, Y Ilboudo, K Liang, Y Chen, S Yoshiji, JB Richards},
  journal={The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism},
  abstract={Context: Trinucleotide repeats in the androgen receptor have been proposed to influence testosterone signaling in men, but the clinical relevance of these trinucleotide repeats remains controversial.

Objective: To examine how androgen receptor trinucleotide repeat lengths affect androgen-related traits and disease risks and whether they influence the clinical importance of circulating testosterone levels.

Methods: We quantified CAG and GGC repeat lengths in the androgen receptor (AR) gene of European-ancestry male participants in UK Biobank from whole-genome and whole-exome sequence data using ExpansionHunter, and tested associations with androgen-related traits and diseases. We also examined whether the associations between testosterone levels and these outcomes were affected by adjustment for the repeat lengths.

Results: We successfully quantified the repeat lengths from whole-genome and/or whole-exome sequence data in 181,217 males. Both repeat lengths were shown to be positively associated with circulating total testosterone level and bone mineral density, whereas CAG repeat length was negatively associated with male-pattern baldness, but their effects were relatively small and were not associated with most of the other outcomes. Circulating total testosterone level was associated with various outcomes, but this relationship was not affected by adjustment for the repeat lengths.

Conclusion: In this large-scale study, we found that longer CAG and GGC repeats in the AR gene influence androgen resistance, elevate circulating testosterone level via a feedback loop and play a role in some androgen-targeted tissues. Generally, however, circulating testosterone level is a more important determinant of androgen action in males than repeat lengths.},
